# run project for development
- install all node_modules (we use yarn `yarn` at project root)
- go to server/ run `nodemon`
- open a new terminal, go to project root and run `gulp`
- open your browser to `localhost:3001` (if it automatially opens your browser manually refresh the page once to make sure everything is loaded)

# Dependencies

The Node server needs a MongoDB to connect to save scores and users. The game will work just fine without the database though.
